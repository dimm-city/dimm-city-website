			<ol>
				<li>
					<h3>Choose a name</h3>
					The first step in connecting to your sporos is to give it a name, from the fanciful to the mundane.
				</li>
				<li>
					<h3>Choose its form</h3>
					Rabbit, cat, monkey, or even an autochthon of your own design.
				</li>
				<li>
					<h3>Choose a specialty for your sporos</h3>
					Augmerc (fighter), Channeler (cleric), Cybersurgeon (doctor), Etherlock (wizard), Gutterdruid (shaman), Proxy (paladin),
					Streetwarden (ranger), Technosorcerer (hacker), Transpiler (con artist/spy), or Wirephreak (standard rogue).
				</li>
				<li>
					<h3>Choose a mood or vibe</h3>
					compassionate, confident, enthusiastic, foolhardy, hilarious, jovial, low-key, reverent, serene, whimsical or any
					combination or vibe you can imagine.
				</li>
				<li>
					<h3>Choose a number from 2 to 5</h3>
					A low number means your better when DREAMING (magic; communication; persuasion; survival in the wild; basically
					your good at hitching a ride on the rampaging dragon that is life). A high number means your stronger AWAKE (athletics,
					science; technology, logic; you easily flow with an extreme situation when in “the zone”).
				</li>
			</ol>

		<div class="table">
			<h3>HP (hit points)</h3>
			The number chosen in step five is also the number of hit points your character's base hit points. During the game your
			character may take damage. All wounds can be healed and HP restored with a full nights rest.

		<div class="table">
			<h3>Basic Inventory</h3>
			You have: any clothes you wish to wear, a dreamcred wallet with a small amount of money on it, a Bananacom&trade; Comlink
			(smartphone), a weapon, wand, or tool (choose one), and one extra item of your choice (with DM permission).
