Hacking in Dimm City requires a specific set of tools. First, you will need what is known as a RootKit or the installation of specialized cybernetic implant that runs RootKit. The kit holds the scripts that are used to attack and defend systems. Cybernetic kits can contain a maximum of three slots and cannot be combined with an external kit. External kits can contain up to seven slots but may not be compatible with some scripts that require a cybernetic connection. 

 

Slots can be filled with either combat scripts or augmentation scripts. Combat scripts are used in attacking and defending systems and devices. Augmentation scripts are used passively to protect and otherwise enhance system / operator capabilities. 

 

Most networks, systems, and cybernetic devices contain their own kit used to defend against incoming attacks. For example, to gain access to a data center, control a surveillance system, or cause an opponent's cybernetics to glitch, you will likely need to defeat that device's embedded kit. 

 

Card effects can target either an operator or an access point. 

Augmentation Scripts effects are applied outside of netrunning and does not require an action or success to be used. 

 

 

How to Netrun 

 

The number of slots contained by the deck determines the decks HP. The total HP is the number of slots time five. So that a deck with seven slots has an HP score of 35. 

 

Slots * 5 = HP 

 

2 slots = 10 HP 

3 slots = 15 HP 

4 slots = 20 HP 

5 slots = 25 HP 

6 slots = 30 HP 

7 slots = 35 HP 

 

Damage incurred from decking is taken directly to the device. Any overflow damage that evades your defense is dealt as physical damage to the operator. Once your deck is depleted of it's HP you are ejected from the target system. Game Over. 

 

Netrunning cards have an attack and defense score and are used actively. Augmentation scripts most be declared at the beginning of combat unless otherwise stated on the script. 

 

Turn based card style game 

Each netrunning card has attack and defense scores 

Some cards contain abilities 

Each round the player and opponent (DM in the case of AP) decides a card to play for that round. 

The cards are shown and the scores compared to determine deck damage dealt. If damage is dealt to the opponents deck any ability on the card is then activated.
