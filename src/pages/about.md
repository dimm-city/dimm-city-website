## The City

The Dimm City RPG combines the dystopian vibes of cyberpunk, the technological brilliance of sci-fi, and the magic of fantasy into one easy-to-run dream of a game!

At its core, Dimm City RPG is a game of choices. It's not just about rolling dice, but about how you, as a player, shape your own reality within the etherbound metropolis of Dimm City.

For tabletop role-playing game (TTRPG) players, you'll revel in the unique blend of strategy and storytelling. Your choices matter, with each action rippling through the fabric of Dimm City. Simple mechanics create quick gameplay that engages both your mind and creativity.

If you're a cyberpunk enthusiast, Dimm City will feel like home. The cityscape is a blend of high-tech marvels and low-life grit. Here, neon lights and shadowy alleys coexist, painting a world that's as thrilling as it is unpredictable.

Sci-fi fans will note that Dimm City RPG dances on the blurred line between reality and dreams, weaving a narrative that's both familiar and alien. The sci-fi elements add a layer of mystery and exploration, pushing the boundaries of what you might consider 'real.'

Fantasy fans, fear not, for Dimm City is infused with an air of mystique and magic. In the metropolis in the mist, the impossible becomes possible, and the mundane turns extraordinary. Your dreams are your magic, bending and shaping the world around you.

In essence, Dimm City RPG is a playground for your imagination, a place where different genres and themes converge to create something unique. It's not just a gameâ€”it's an experience. Your dream awaits.

Dimm City welcomes anyone who wants to dream with us to pick up a super simple [SPORE (one-page RPG)](/spores) to try out an easy game or purchase the Dreamer's Guide to Dimm City and go a little deeper into the setting.

There is canon content and we also invite you, the Dreamer, to create in the world as well through journaling on dimm.city and shaping the world through a submission process to add your player-created content to the canon.

Dimm City awaits! 

## The Founders

Our team has created a cyberpunk/solarpunk game that is rules-light enough to allow beginners to play, yet has enough optional rules to make it appealing to gamers who like a little more crunch.

Dimm City is the product of our lead artist Scott Georges' art and ideas from the last 30 years of his work. TWard has taken his collection, adapted it, and developed it into the TTRPG content we have published and wish to publish in the future. IT Lackey is our technomancer, working his magic on the site and innovating programs and applications that will add to the Dreamer and Dream Master's experience, making the game easier and more fun to play. Last but by no means least, Matt Pini is the media and business guru of the project, creating audio and video content along with leading the team with financial know-how and handling the business legwork to bring this thing to the world.

We are working toward creating a simple game made simpler by integrating online support and resources that will assist in playing, planning, and running the game.
